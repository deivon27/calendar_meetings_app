# Calendar Meetings WebApp

Hi, Bohdan here. This app is my first Web App submitted on Github.

1. To use it you need to download the source files to the root of your web hosting.
2. Create Database and import db_structure.sql file to the database created
3. Set up some app parameters in /config/app_params.php 
4. Set up the Database credentials in /config/db_params.php
5. Set up the SMTP Mail Server credentials in/config/smtp_params.php (optionally)
6. Enjoy=)
